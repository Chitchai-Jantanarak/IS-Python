## Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Supervised Learning**: 
   - Algorithms are trained on labeled data
   - Goal is to learn a function that maps input to output
   - Examples: Classification, Regression

2. **Unsupervised Learning**:
   - Algorithms work on unlabeled data
   - Discover hidden patterns or groupings
   - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction

3. **Types of Machine Learning Algorithms**:
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forests
   - Support Vector Machines
   - Neural Networks
   - K-Means Clustering

### Applications:
- Predictive Analytics
- Image and Speech Recognition
- Recommendation Systems
- Fraud Detection
- Autonomous Vehicles
